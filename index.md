# Cinna's First CS193 Homework 

## Favorite things about CS193

- The TAs are cool.
- The room is nice and air conditioned.
- Its only once a week.
- I used github for like 4 years and this is the first time I actually made a website, thanks for that. 
- 193 is a more interesting number than 191 or 180.
